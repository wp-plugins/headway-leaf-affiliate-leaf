Allows users to easily add an powered by box to their site. A Headway leaf to help you promote the Headway Theme.

== Description ==

We wanted an easier way for our affiliates to display a box on their site. This leaf enables you to do that. Add the leaf wherever you want, however we think it’s best on the Single Post page in between two content leafs.

Once you’ve added the leaf just select one of the styles or add a custom CSS class and take over full design control.

This leaf will display a clickable image and two links in the text. It takes the affiliate link you’ve setup in Headway’s configuration and uses that link for all three links.

This plugin requires [Headway Themes](http://headwaythemes.com) to be installed and activated for it to work.
